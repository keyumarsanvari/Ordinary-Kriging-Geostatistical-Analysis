## 📄 Description

This notebook demonstrates how to apply **Ordinary Kriging**, a powerful geostatistical interpolation technique, to estimate geochemical properties in 2D or 3D space based on borehole sample data.

Kriging helps model spatial variability and uncertainty in geological data by incorporating both the distance and the degree of variation between known data points.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Load and visualize borehole or spatial geochemical data.
- Set up a variogram model.
- Apply **Ordinary Kriging** (via `pykrige`) in 2D or 3D.
- Generate interpolated maps or volumes of predicted values.
- Visualize spatial interpolation results using `matplotlib` or `pyvista`.

## 📚 Requirements

Make sure to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib pykrige pyvista
```


## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure your data is structured with spatial coordinates (`X`, `Y`, optionally `Z`) and one or more variables of interest.
